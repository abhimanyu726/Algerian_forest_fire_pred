## Overview

This project aims to predict forest fires in Algeria using machine learning models. By analyzing environmental factors and historical data, this tool helps identify potential fire hazards and provides insights for effective fire management.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for forest fire prediction
- Machine learning models to predict fire occurrence based on environmental features
- Visualization of model performance
- User-friendly interface with Streamlit for interactive predictions

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Algerian Forest Fires dataset**, containing information on weather conditions and fire incidents across different regions in Algeria.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
